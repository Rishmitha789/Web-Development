<h1>Best movies according to me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Agent Sai Srinivas Atreya</h3>
<p>A mix of comedy and crime with well executed plot with a really smooth transaction from light hearted comedy to bone chilling crime solving.</p>
<h3>Journey to the centre of the Earth</h3>
<p>Really good mix of comedyand adventure one of the earliest moviesthat remember from childhood.</p>
<h3>Enola Holmes</h3>
<p>Watched the movie after reading the novels. Although quite disimilar from the relatively dark and dangerous plot the novel still quite enjoyable and appeasing to the audience.</p>
